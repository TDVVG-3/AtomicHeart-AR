# DECISIONS

Every major technical decision is recorded here (per MASTER_PROMPT.md §51).

---

## DEC-001 — Repository layout follows MASTER_PROMPT.md §8

Date: 2026-10-17

Decision:
Use the directory structure defined in MASTER_PROMPT.md section 8 without modification
(source / localization / glossary / fonts / build / dist / reports / qa / docs / scripts / tools).

Reason:
The spec is authoritative; no game-specific constraint requires a change yet.

Consequence:
Future extraction and build scripts have fixed, documented output locations.

---

## DEC-002 — Game installation is strictly read-only

Date: 2026-10-17

Decision:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Atomic Heart` is treated as read-only.
All hashing/scanning is read-only. No files are written, moved, or deleted there.
The `~mods` folder will only be created (when it does not exist) at the install step,
which has not happened yet and requires user approval of the prototype.

Reason:
Hard rule from user brief and MASTER_PROMPT.md §0/§1 (never destroy source data).

Consequence:
Nothing in the game folder changes during Phases 1–4. Steam verification remains intact.

---

## DEC-003 — Do not install Git system-wide without approval

Date: 2026-10-17

Decision:
Git is not installed on this machine. Version control is a spec requirement (§45),
but installing software system-wide requires telling the user first. The project runs
fine without Git for now; the question is deferred to the user.

Reason:
User hard rule 4: "Install nothing system-wide without telling the user first."

Consequence:
`git init` is pending. All files are ready to be committed once Git is available.
The user will be asked to approve a Git for Windows install (winget) at the end of this cycle.

---

## DEC-004 — Project license: MIT (code/documentation only)

Date: 2026-10-17

Decision:
Project-owned code and documentation use the MIT license. No game content is included,
so no game license is affected. Third-party tools/fonts keep their own licenses
(recorded later in THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).

Reason:
Spec requires a LICENSE file; MIT is the least restrictive standard choice for
scripts and docs, and does not conflict with anything.

Consequence:
Contributors know the terms; game assets remain untouched and unlicensed by this project.

---

## DEC-005 — repak is the primary PAK tool; UnrealPak deferred

Date: 2026-10-17

Decision:
Use repak v0.2.3 (Apache-2.0) as the primary PAK pack/unpack tool. Defer UnrealPak
(Epic proprietary) unless repak proves incompatible.

Reason:
The game's PAKs are UE4 legacy v11 with an UNENCRYPTED index. repak parsed all 19
archives successfully, including the custom Mundfish JSON pre-header (it seeks the
footer magic). No AES key is needed. repak is open-source, auditable, and does not
require an Unreal Engine install.

Consequence:
No Epic binaries in the repo. Toolchain stays open-source and redistributable for the
pack/unpack path. UnrealPak remains a documented fallback only.

---

## DEC-006 — Localization is split: locres + non-locres UI assets

Date: 2026-10-17

Decision:
Treat the project as covering TWO text systems, not one:
  (A) Unreal LocRes v3 for dialogue/cutscene/notes/terminal/lore.
  (B) Cooked StringTable/DataTable/DataAsset FText for main UI
      (GameTips, weapon upgrades, skills, quests, items, DLC notes).
Plan and size the pipeline for both. Do not declare the translation complete on locres
alone (per MASTER_PROMPT section 28).

Reason:
`DefaultGame.ini` declares 52 localization targets, but core UI targets (Game, UI,
Widgets, WBP, Quests, Skills, Weapons_Items, GameTips, LoreMenu, Loading Screen) have
NO locres in any pak. Their text is served from cooked assets
(e.g. ST_GameTips_Texts, DT_WeaponUpgradesTexts, DA_UpgradesTexts, NTD_StringTable).

Consequence:
Phase 5 must include an asset-class-aware extraction pass (FModel/UAssetGUI) in addition
to locres extraction. Non-locres work is likely the larger effort. This is recorded as a
scope risk in reports/non_locres_text.md.

---

## DEC-007 — Defer carrier-culture choice (Strategy A vs C) until prototype

Date: 2026-10-17

Decision:
Do NOT choose between adding a native `ar` culture (Strategy A) and reusing an existing
text slot (Strategy C) yet. Both remain open. Decide only after the Phase 7/8 prototype
proves which the game will actually load.

Reason:
14 cultures are staged via `CulturesToStage` inside a pak; `LocalizationTargetCatchAll
ChunkId=0` exists, so an injected `ar` folder *might* load, but this is UNKNOWN until
tested. Choosing now would be inventing a value (violates section 5).

Consequence:
Prototype must test native `ar` first (least invasive). If it fails, fall back to Strategy
C and clearly tell the user which language slot Arabic replaces.
